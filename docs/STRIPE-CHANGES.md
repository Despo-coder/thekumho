# Stripe Integration Changes

## Issues Fixed

We addressed several issues with the Stripe integration:

1. **Client-Side Secret Key Exposure**: Prevented the Stripe secret key from being exposed to the client by restructuring the Stripe configuration.

2. **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced error messages and logging throughout the payment flow.

3. **Enhanced Security**: Implemented proper server-side vs. client-side separation for Stripe operations.

4. **Better Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging for easier troubleshooting.

5. **TypeScript & Linting Issues**: Fixed all TypeScript errors and ESLint warnings to improve code quality and prevent potential runtime issues.

## Key Files Modified

### 1. Stripe Configuration (`lib/stripe/config.ts`)

- Separated client-side and server-side code
- Implemented a `getStripeInstance()` function that only runs on the server
- Added safety checks to prevent client-side access to secret keys
- Improved error handling and logging

### 2. Payment API (`app/api/payment/route.ts`)

- Enhanced error handling with detailed messages
- Added proper validation for request data
- Improved logging of payment intent creation
- Used the server-side only `getStripeInstance()` function
- Fixed TypeScript type issues with proper type guards
- Implemented safe error handling patterns with unknown types

### 3. Webhook Handler (`app/api/webhook/stripe/route.ts`)

- Improved error handling for webhook events
- Added better logging of webhook processing
- Separated error handling for event processing
- Added proper type definitions for Stripe objects
- Implemented safe type guards for error handling

### 4. Checkout Components

- Fixed unescaped entities in text content for better accessibility
- Removed unused variables in Stripe components
- Improved error message display for payment failures
- Enhanced user experience with proper loading states

## Documentation Added

1. **Stripe Integration Readme** (`README-STRIPE.md`)
   - Setup instructions
   - Implementation details
   - Testing information
   - Security considerations

2. **Troubleshooting Guide** (`STRIPE-TROUBLESHOOTING.md`)
   - Common error solutions
   - Testing instructions
   - Debugging tips
   - Environment variable help

## Environment Variables Required

The integration requires the following environment variables:

```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_stripe_webhook_secret
```

## Next Steps

1. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set in your `.env.local` file.
2. Restart your development server to apply the changes.
3. Test the payment flow using Stripe test cards.
4. Check server logs for any error messages during payment processing.
