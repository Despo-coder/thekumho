## Current Status
After initial testing, we've found that several features are functioning well:
- Authentication works for both admin and regular users
- Menu page displays seeded items correctly with ratings
- Reservation form works for creating new bookings
- Featured dishes on homepage now display highest-rated items

Next steps:
- Focus on implementing the admin-side management features as per priority list in [Admin Action Points](./admin-action-points.md)
- Begin with Menu Management System as the top priority
- Proceed with Order Processing and Reservation Management next

Some issues to address:
- Orders page isn't displaying the seeded orders
- Admin dashboard isn't showing seeded bookings, orders or users
- Dietary filters on menu page need functional implementation
- Shopping cart functionality needs to be implemented
