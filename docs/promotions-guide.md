## Overview

The promotions system allows restaurant administrators to create various types of special offers and discounts to attract customers and drive sales. Promotions can be applied automatically or via coupon codes entered at checkout.

Key features include:
- Multiple promotion types (percentage discounts, fixed amounts, free items, and buy-one-get-one)
- Time-based promotions with start and end dates
- Coupon code functionality
- Targeting specific menu items or categories
- Usage limits and tracking

## Promotion Types

The system supports four types of promotions:

### 1. Percentage Discount
Applies a percentage discount to eligible items or the entire order.
- Example: "20% off all appetizers"
- Configuration: Set percentage value (e.g., 20)

### 2. Fixed Amount Discount
Applies a fixed amount discount to eligible items or the entire order.
- Example: "$5 off orders over $30"
- Configuration: Set amount value (e.g., 5.00) and minimum order value (e.g., 30.00)

### 3. Free Item
Adds a specific menu item for free when qualifying purchases are made.
- Example: "Free dessert with any entrÃ©e purchase"
- Configuration: Select the free item from the menu items list

### 4. Buy One Get One (BOGO)
When purchasing eligible items, the lowest-priced item is free.
- Example: "Buy one pizza, get one free"
- Configuration: No additional configuration needed beyond selecting eligible items

The promotions management interface provides several tools:

### Promotions Table

- Type and value
- Status (Active, Scheduled, Expired, Inactive)
- Date range
- Usage statistics

### Editing Promotions

1. Click the Edit button next to the promotion in the table
2. Make your changes across the tabs
3. Save changes

### Deleting Promotions
To delete a promotion:
1. Click the Delete button next to the promotion in the table
2. Confirm deletion in the confirmation dialog

### Tracking Usage
Usage statistics show how many times each promotion has been applied, helping you evaluate its effectiveness.

## Applying Promotions at Checkout

Promotions can be applied to orders in two ways:

### Automatic Application
Promotions without coupon codes are applied automatically at checkout if:
- The promotion is active
- The current date is within the promotion's date range
- The order meets minimum requirements
- The usage limit hasn't been reached

### Coupon Codes
For promotions with coupon codes:
1. The customer enters the code in the coupon input field at checkout
2. The system validates the code and eligibility
3. If valid, the discount is applied to the order

### Implementation in Checkout Flow

To integrate the coupon code functionality in the checkout flow:

1. Add the `CouponInput` component to your checkout page:

```tsx
import { CouponInput } from "@/app/checkout/coupon-input";

// Inside your checkout component
const [promotion, setPromotion] = useState(null);
const [discount, setDiscount] = useState(0);

const handleApplyCoupon = (newPromotion, newDiscount) => {
  setPromotion(newPromotion);
  setDiscount(newDiscount);
  // Recalculate order total
  updateTotal(subtotal - newDiscount);
};

// In your JSX
<CouponInput 
  onApply={handleApplyCoupon}
  cartItems={cartItems}
  cartTotal={subtotal}
  disabled={isProcessing}
/>

// When displaying the order summary
<div className="order-summary">
  <div className="subtotal">Subtotal: ${subtotal.toFixed(2)}</div>
  {discount > 0 && (
    <div className="discount">
      Discount ({promotion.name}): -${discount.toFixed(2)}
    </div>
  )}
  <div className="total">Total: ${(subtotal - discount).toFixed(2)}</div>
</div>
```

2. When creating the order, include the promotion information:

```tsx
// When submitting the order
const createOrder = async () => {
  // ... other order creation logic
  
  // If a promotion was applied
  if (promotion) {
    // Include promotion ID with the order
    orderData.appliedPromotionId = promotion.id;
    orderData.discountAmount = discount;
    
    // After order is created, record promotion usage
    await fetch('/api/promotions/apply', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ 
        promotionId: promotion.id, 
        orderId: createdOrder.id 
      })
    });
  }
  
  // ... continue with order completion
};
```

## Technical Implementation

The promotions system is implemented across several parts of the application:

### Database Schema

The `Promotion` model in the Prisma schema includes:

```prisma
model Promotion {
  id                String        @id @default(cuid())
  name              String
  description       String?
  promotionType     PromotionType
  value             Decimal       // Percentage or fixed amount
  minimumOrderValue Decimal?      // For minimum purchase requirements
  startDate         DateTime
  endDate           DateTime
  isActive          Boolean       @default(true)

  // For FREE_ITEM promotions
  freeItemId        String?
  freeItem          MenuItem?     @relation(fields: [freeItemId], references: [id])

  // For coupon codes
  couponCode        String?       @unique
  usageLimit        Int?          // Max number of uses
  usageCount        Int           @default(0)

  // For specific menu items or categories
  applyToAllItems   Boolean       @default(false)
  menuItems         MenuItem[]    @relation("MenuItemPromotions")
  categories        Category[]    @relation("CategoryPromotions")

  // For tracking
  createdAt         DateTime      @default(now())
  updatedAt         DateTime      @updatedAt

  // Relations
  appliedOrders     Order[]
}

enum PromotionType {
  PERCENTAGE_DISCOUNT
  FIXED_AMOUNT_DISCOUNT
  FREE_ITEM
  BUY_ONE_GET_ONE
}
```

### Server Actions

Server actions in `lib/actions/promotion-action.ts` handle the business logic for creating, updating, and managing promotions.

### API Routes

The API routes in `app/api/promotions/` handle validation and application of promotions, with key endpoints:
- `validate/route.ts`: Validates coupon codes and calculates discounts
- `apply/route.ts`: Records promotion usage and links promotions to orders

### UI Components

- Admin UI: The promotions tab in the menu management interface
- Customer UI: The coupon input component for checkout

## Best Practices

### Effective Promotion Strategies

1. **Limited-Time Offers**: Create urgency with short-duration promotions
2. **Seasonal Promotions**: Align offers with holidays or seasons
3. **New Item Promotions**: Encourage trying new menu items
4. **Minimum Purchase Promotions**: Increase average order value
5. **Loyalty Rewards**: Encourage repeat business

### Implementation Tips

1. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify all promotion types work as expected before going live
2. **Monitor Usage**: Track which promotions are most effective
